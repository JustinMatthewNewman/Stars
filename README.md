This program was designed by Justin Newman at James Madison University for John Salem's Telemedia Productions
to help create quick and accurate graphics for all college sports rosters based on the athlete's biography.

This program was designed in Java 13 with JSoup to access a web URL's HTML source code and parse each player's
statistics into bins for easy and efficient data retrieval.

The software features multiple modes where the user may choose to scan for graphics or quick render an entire 
team's stats onto template images.

The computer running the software must be connected to the internet to access the roster.

The software was designed for a Mac OS java workspace however should work on windows machines with java installed.
